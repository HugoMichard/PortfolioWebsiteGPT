# Welcome to WebsiteGPT

WebsiteGPT is a platform to conceive your own custom assistant powered by ChatGPT in only a few clicks.

An Assistant can leverage specific knowledge you introduce to respond to user queries. The Assistant currently supports three types of data: Website, Document, and specific Question & Answer. In the future, we plan to release more types of data to allow you to provide a more diverse flux of incoming knowledge to your assistant on our platform.
